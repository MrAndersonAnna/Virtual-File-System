 -> Syntax:

	int stricmp(const char *string1, const char *string2);
	
	Description:

	stricmp compares string1 and string2 without sensitivity to case. All alphabetic characters 
	in the two arguments string1 and string2 are converted to lowercase before the comparison.

	to contain a null character (\0) marking the end of the string.

	Return Value

	Less than 0 -> string1 less than string2 
	0 -> string1 equivalent to string2 
	Greater than 0 -> string1 greater than string2
