Virtual File System

  Virtual File System (VFS) or virtual filesystem switch is an abstraction layer 
 on top of a more concrete file system. The purpose of a VFS is to allow client 
 applications to access different types of concrete file systems in a uniform way.

  The virtual file system provides all the functionality to the user  which is
same as the UNIX based file system. It provides all necessary commands and
system calls implementations of file system through customised shell.
In these project we implement all necessary data structures of File Subsystem
as Inode, Incore Inode Table, File Table, User File Descriptor Table etc.
By using these project we can emulate UNIX file system on any windows platform.

  A virtual File System (VFS), sometimes referred to as a Hidden File System, 
is a storage technique most commonly used by kernel mode malware, usually to 
store components outside of the existing filesystem. By using a virtual filesystem, 
malware developers can both bypass antivirus scanners as well as complicating work 
for forensic experts.
